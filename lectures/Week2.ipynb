    "As always we'll learn about degree-distribution plotting by creating a `notebook` and trying it out. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> _Exercises_:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Begin by importing the right packages. Start by importing `matplolib.pyplot` (for plotting), `numpy` (for binning and other stuff), \n",
    "> `random` (for generating random numbers), and `networkx` (for generating networks.)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * Binning real numbers\n",
    ">   * Let's do a gentle start and use the `random` library generate 5000 data points from a Gaussian distribution with $\\mu = 2$ and $\\sigma = 0.125$.\n",
    ">   * Now, let's use `numpy.histogram` to bin those number into 10 bins. What does the `numpy.histogram` function return? Do the two arrays have the same length?\n",
    ">   * Then we use `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` to plot the binned data. You will have to deal with the fact that the counts- and bin-arrays have different lengths. Explain how you deal with this problem and why.\n",
    "> * Binning integers\n",
    ">   * But binning real numbers into a fixed number of bins is easy when `numpy.histogram` does all the work and finds the right bin boundaries for you. \n",
    "> Now we'll generate a bunch of integers and set the bin boundaries manually. This time, let's grab data from a Poisson distribution. As it turns out \n",
    "> `numpy` also has some convenient random number generators. Use `numpy.random.poission` to generate 5000 numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution \n",
    "> characterized by $\\lambda = 10$. Find the maximum and minimum value of your 5000 random numbers. \n",
    ">   * Instead of simplify specifying the number of bins for `numpy.histogram`, let's specify the bins we want using a vector. Create a vector \n",
    "> that results in a binning that puts each integer value in its own bin and where the first bin contains the minimum number you found above, \n",
    "> and the last bin contains the maximum number. What is the sum over bin counts? Explain how the binning-vectors first and last element \n",
    "> relates to the min and max from the Poisson distribution.\n",
    ">   * Now, use a bar chart (`matplotlib.pyplot.bar`) to plot the distribution \n",
    "> * Binning and plotting degree distributions. \n",
    ">   * Let's generate the ErdÃ¶s-Renyi (ER) network which has a degree distribution that matches the Poisson distribution above. \n",
    "> First we have to figure out which values the ER parameters (_N_ and _p_) should assume. It's easy to see that $N = 5000$, but how do you find $p$? \n",
    "> **Hint**: The parameter $\\lambda$ in the Poisson distribution corresponds to the average degree, so you have to find a $p$ that results in an average \n",
    "> degree, $k = 10$. And you know that $\\langle k \\rangle = p (N-1)$, which will give you $p$. Note that Python by default returns the result of divisions as the most precise of the datatypes involved (for instance, try computing `1/2` and `1.0/2.0` in your notebook). If you want division to always give you a decimal number, you can enter `from __future__ import division` at the beginning of your notebook.\n",
    ">   * Now, use `networkx` to create the graph and extract the degree distribution.\n",
    ">   * Finally, create a nice bar plot of the degree distribution, including axes labels and a plot title. Make sure that it looks like the Poisson distribution you plotted above.\n",
